# atd

atd is the ofono/ModemManager replacement used in cactus, an oasis-based Linux
system for the Pinephone. It exposes a Unix socket interface, and uses the
modem's AT interface in order to make calls, send texts, and handle URCs (i.e.
deal with incoming calls and texts).

More documentation coming soon!
